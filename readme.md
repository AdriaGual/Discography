## Installation Notes

For this project, there are 2 important dependencies needed, Composer and Laravel (here's a webpage tutorial: https://laravel.com/docs/4.2).

After that, you need to install XAMPP or an Apache distribution (with PHP >= 5.4).

Put all the repository files into (C:/xampp/htdocs/project).


## Importing the Database

If you're running into a localhost, just go to localhost/phpmyadmin.

From there, create a new Database named "discography".

Import the file "discography.sql".

## Running

Run Xampp and enable Apache and MySQL.

Go to localhost/project/public on your browser.
